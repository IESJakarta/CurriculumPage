Monthly Curriculum Page

This is the link to my prototype for a dynamically generated curriculum page.

https://msrody.github.io/MonthlyCurPage/

The links are generated from data stored in a Google sheet. The sheet is fed data by a Google Form. The form receives the various resource links submitted for each month's curriculum along with some other pertinent data. The sheet makes it's data available via json which is imported by the website. The data for a given month is shown or not shown by making or unmarking a cell in the spreadsheet. The month's data is only shown when the "Show" cell in the spreadsheet row for that month is marked.

Why is this significant? 

It will significantly simplifies monthly Curriculum link production. The links can be copied into the form.  When the form is submitted the spreadsheet may be accessed to set the "Show" column. 

Additional functionality to add:
* Mobile friendly sizing.
* Video frame for preview.
* Special frame segment.
