Monthly Curriculum Page

This is the link to my initial prototype for our dynamically generated curriculum page.

https://msrody.github.io/MonthlyCurPage/

The links are from a Google sheet. The sheet is fed by a Google form where resource links are submitted for each month. The data in the sheet can be shown in the website or removed by making our unmarking one cell. It is only shown when the "Show" cell in the spreadsheet is marked.

Why is this significant? It will, if ever finished, make for a much simplified method to distribute our curriculum 

Additional functionality to add:
* Mobile friendly sizing.
* Dynamic colors for tiles, fonts and background.
* Video frame for preview.
* Special frame segment.
